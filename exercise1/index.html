<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi all, my name is Kahner Cleveland and I'm a junior with a primary major of Environmental Science and a secondary major of Environmental Studies. I am also minoring in GIS. I am located on campus this semester. I have very little experience with HTML & JavaScript and coding, however, I've taken several GIS classes and have significant (to me) GIS experience. I hope to gain further understanding of web GIS and coding to help further my understanding of GIS technologies in this class, and I am excited to learn new skills that will help me in my career..</p>
